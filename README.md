# About this project

Iâ€™m sharing my personal setup in the hope that it may be beneficial to others. This Bash configuration file
is designed to automate repetitive tasks (such as constantly executing `ls` after `cd`) and shorten lengthy commands. 
It contains functions and aliases that I regularly update based on my needs on Kubuntu 24 and Debian 12.

Contributions and feedbacks are welcome.

## Installation instructions

#### 1. Download the `.bash_aliases.sh` file or clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Julien-Fischer/bash_aliases
```

#### 2. Copy `.bash_aliases.sh` to your home directory
```
cp bash_aliases/bash_aliases.sh ~
```

#### 3. Add the following lines in `~/.bashrc`:
```
if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases.sh ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases.sh
fi
```

#### 4. Reload your bash configuration
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Notes:** For further reloads, just open your CLI and type: `reload`

## Upgrades

If you already installed this project, you can upgrade it to the latest version by typing: 
```
upgrade_aliases 
```

This function will: 
- clone this repository in the current working directory
- create a backup of the current `~/.bash_aliases.sh` file
- copy the new `.bash_aliases.sh` file in `home`
- remove the cloned directory
- reload `.bashrc`.

## Requirements

This setup was primarily tested on Kubuntu 24 and Debian 12.

Most of the functions/aliases defined in this project should be compatible with Debian-based distributions.
